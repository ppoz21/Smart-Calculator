  <p>Joe defined&nbsp;a dictionary listing his favorite artists, their albums, and the song from each of the albums. It looks as follows:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">tracks = {"Woodkid": {"The Golden Age": "Run Boy Run",
                      "On the Other Side": "Samara"},
          "alt-J": {"This Is All Yours": "Left Hand Free",
                    "RELAXER": "In Cold Blood",
                    "An Awesome Wave": "Breezeblocks"}}</code></pre> 
  <p>&nbsp;Joe's&nbsp;tastes can change, though.</p> 
  <p>Your task is to define a <code class="language-python">tracklist()</code> function that would take several keyword arguments representing musicians.&nbsp;It should print the values from the dictionary in the following form:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Woodkid
ALBUM: The Golden Age TRACK: Run Boy Run
ALBUM: On the Other Side TRACK: Samara
alt-J
ALBUM: This Is All Yours TRACK: Left Hand Free
ALBUM: RELAXER TRACK: In Cold Blood
ALBUM: An Awesome Wave TRACK: Breezeblocks</code></pre> 
  <p>Avoid extra spaces. You do not need to call a function, just implement it.</p>
